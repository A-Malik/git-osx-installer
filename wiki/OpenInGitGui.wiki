To install, [http://git-osx-installer.googlecode.com/files/OpenInGitGui.zip download], and extract to /Applications/Scripts (you'll need to create the Scripts directory, likely).  Then, find the icon, and drag it up to your toolbar.  Keep it there for a few seconds until it "sticks".

To use, open finder to a folder with a git repository, and click the "Git" icon.
