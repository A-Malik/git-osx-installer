To install, [http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?q=label:Featured], and extract to /Applications/Scripts (you'll need to create the Scripts directory, likely).  Then, find the icon, and drag it up to your toolbar.  Keep it there for a few seconds until it "sticks".

To use, open finder to a folder with a git repository, and click the "Git" icon.

= CHANGELOG =

- Version 2.0 -

* No longer require an open terminal to get ssh fetches to work. (uses an invisible daemonized screen session instead). 
* Sometimes 2 git-gui instances would be launched by the droplet. That has been addressed and should only happen on extremely rare occasions. 
* Now sports an AWESOME icon (thanks Jake Smith)
